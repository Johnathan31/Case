## cased class ⚒️
this class provides every feature of this module, from the path/case/style to repeating the text in the matter of moments.
It's all simple: make an instance of _cased_ class:
```python
from Case import cased

example: cased = cased("I love python")
```
And congrats 🎉! You unlocked all the features, and you can do such things like:
```python
print(example.ct_vowels()) # 5
print(example.snake()) # 'I_love_python'
print(example.Pascal().swapcase()) # 'i lOVE pYTHON'
```
